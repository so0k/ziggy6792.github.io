# Mofos engineering Tech Blog

Mofos sharing their learnings.

Notes:

- This blog is maintained using hugo, you need hugo to generate the static html
- This repository uses submodules, after cloning pull all submodules as follows

   ```
   git submodule update --init
   ```

   Note gists are under so0k personal account, maybe you can't pull the gists?

- The actual Static HTML is hosted on GitHub Pages with a CNAME set to swatmobileio.github.io - you need to be added to the GitHub organization to add articles.
- The original theme did not support multiple authors for this blog, I added support following [this guide](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/07/24/hugo-tips-how-to-create-author-pages/)
